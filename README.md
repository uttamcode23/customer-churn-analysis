# Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using real-world data. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and build a predictive model that helps businesses improve customer retention.
# Project Objectives
- Understand customer behavior and patterns that lead to churn
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction
- Derive actionable insights to reduce churn rate
# Tools & Technologies Used
- Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook**
- Git & GitHub** for version control
# Key Steps in the Project
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and data formatting
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized churn distribution, correlations, and trends
3. Feature Engineering:
   - Created new features to enhance model performance
4. Model Building:
   - Trained multiple models and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
5. Insights & Recommendations:
   - Identified top churn indicators and provided retention strategies
